code for reading and writing an actual binary format, that of ID3
tags. ID3 tags are used to embed metadata in MP3 audio files. Dealing
with ID3 tags will be a good test of the binary data library because
the ID3 format is a true real-world format--a mix of engineering
trade-offs and idiosyncratic design choices that does, whatever else
might be said about it, get the job done. In case you missed the
file-sharing revolution, here's a quick overview of what ID3 tags are
and how they relate to MP3 files.</P><P>MP3, also known as MPEG Audio Layer 3, is a format for storing
compressed audio data, designed by researchers at Fraunhofer IIS and
standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group, a joint committee
of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). However, the MP3
format, by itself, defines only how to store audio data. That's fine
as long as all your MP3 files are managed by a single application
that can store metadata externally and keep track of which metadata
goes with which files. However, when people started passing around
individual MP3 files on the Internet, via file-sharing systems such
as Napster, they soon discovered they needed a way to embed metadata
in the MP3 files themselves.</P><P>Because the MP3 standard was already codified and a fair bit of
software and hardware had already been written that knew how to
decode the existing MP3 format, any scheme for embedding information
in an MP3 file would have to be invisible to MP3 decoders. Enter ID3.</P><P>The original ID3 format, invented by programmer Eric Kemp, consisted
of 128 bytes stuck on the end of an MP3 file where it'd be ignored by
most MP3 software. It consisted of four 30-character fields, one each
for the song title, the album title, the artist name, and a comment;
a four-byte year field; and a one-byte genre code. Kemp provided
standard meanings for the first 80 genre codes. Nullsoft, the makers
of Winamp, a popular MP3 player, later supplemented this list with
another 60 or so genres.</P><P>This format was easy to parse but obviously quite limited. It had no
way to encode names longer than 30 characters; it was limited to 256
genres, and the meaning of the genre codes had to be agreed upon by
all users of ID3-aware software. There wasn't even a way to encode
the CD track number of a particular MP3 file until another
programmer, Michael Mutschler, proposed embedding the track number in
the comment field, separated from the rest of the comment by a null
byte, so existing ID3 software, which tended to read up to the first
null in each of the text fields, would ignore it. Kemp's version is
now called ID3v1, and Mutschler's is ID3v1.1.</P><P>Limited as they were, the version 1 proposals were at least a partial
solution to the metadata problem, so they were adopted by many MP3
ripping programs (which had to put the ID3 tag into the MP3 files)
and MP3 players (which would extract the information in the ID3 tag
to display to the user).<SUP>1</SUP></P><P>By 1998, however, the limitations were really becoming annoying, and
a new group, led by Martin Nilsson, started work on a completely new
tagging scheme, which came to be called ID3v2. The ID3v2 format is
extremely flexible, allowing for many kinds of information to be
included, with almost no length limitations. It also takes advantage
of certain details of the MP3 format to allow ID3v2 tags to be placed
at the beginning of an MP3 file.</P><P>ID3v2 tags are, however, more of a challenge to parse than version 1
tags. In this chapter, you'll use the binary data parsing library
from the previous chapter to develop code that can read and write
ID3v2 tags. Or at least you'll make a reasonable start--where ID3v1
was too simple, ID3v2 is baroque to the point of being completely
overengineered. Implementing every nook and cranny of the
specification, especially if you want to support all three versions
that have been specified, would be a fair bit of work. However, you
can ignore many of the features in those specifications since they're
rarely used &quot;in the wild.&quot; For starters, you can ignore, for now, a
whole version, 2.4, since it has not been widely adopted and mostly
just adds more needless flexibility compared to version 2.3. I'll
focus on versions 2.2 and 2.3 because they're both widely used and
are different enough from each other to keep things interesting.</P><A NAME="structure-of-an-id3v2-tag"><H2>Structure of an ID3v2 Tag</H2></A><P>Before you can start cutting code, you'll need to be familiar with
the overall structure of an ID3v2 tag. A tag starts with a header
containing information about the tag as a whole. The first three
bytes of the header encode the string &quot;ID3&quot; in ISO-8859-1 characters.
In other words, they're the bytes 73, 68, and 51. Then comes two
bytes that encode the major version and revision of the ID3
specification to which the tag purports to conform. They're followed
by a single byte whose individual bits are treated as flags. The
meanings of the individual flags depend on the version of the spec.
Some of the flags can affect the way the rest of the tag is parsed.
The &quot;major version&quot; is actually used to record the minor version of
the spec, while the &quot;revision&quot; is the subminor version of the spec.
Thus, the &quot;major version&quot; field for a tag conforming to the 2.3.0
spec is 3. The revision field is always zero since each new ID3v2
spec has bumped the minor version, leaving the subminor version at
zero. The value stored in the major version field of the tag has, as
you'll see, a dramatic effect on how you'll parse the rest of the
tag.</P><P>The last field in the tag header is an integer, encoded in four bytes
but using only seven bits from each byte, that gives the total size
of the tag, not counting the header. In version 2.3 tags, the header
may be followed by several <I>extended header</I> fields; otherwise, the
remainder of the tag data is divided into <I>frames</I>. Different types
of frames store different kinds of information, from simple textual
information, such as the song name, to embedded images. Each frame
starts with a header containing a string identifier and a size. In
version 2.3, the frame header also contains two bytes worth of flags
and, depending on the value of one the flags, an optional one-byte
code indicating how the rest of the frame is encrypted.</P><P>Frames are a perfect example of a tagged data structure--to know how
to parse the body of a frame, you need to read the header and use the
identifier to determine what kind of frame you're reading.</P><P>The ID3 tag header contains no direct indication of how many frames
are in a tag--the tag header tells you how big the tag is, but since
many frames are variable length, the only way to find out how many
frames the tag contains is to read the frame data. Also, the size
given in the tag header may be larger than the actual number of bytes
of frame data; the frames may be followed with enough null bytes to
pad the tag out to the specified size. This makes it possible for tag
editors to modify a tag without having to rewrite the whole MP3
file.<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>So, the main issues you have to deal with are reading the ID3 header;
determining whether you're reading a version 2.2 or 2.3 tag; and
reading the frame data, stopping either when you've read the complete
tag or when you've hit the padding bytes.</P><A NAME="defining-a-package"><H2>Defining a Package</H2></A><P>Like the other libraries you've developed so far, the code you'll
write in this chapter is worth putting in its own package. You'll
need to refer to functions from both the binary data and pathname
libraries developed in Chapters 24 and 15 and will also want to
export the names of the functions that make up the public API to this
package. The following package definition does all that:</P><PRE>(defpackage :com.gigamonkeys.id3v2
  (:use :common-lisp
        :com.gigamonkeys.binary-data
        :com.gigamonkeys.pathnames)
  (:export
   :read-id3
   :mp3-p
   :id3-p

   :composer
   :genre
   :encoding-program
   :artist
   :part-of-set
   :track
   :song
   :year
   :size
   :translated-genre))</PRE><P>As usual, you can, and probably should, change the
<CODE>com.gigamonkeys</CODE> part of the package name to your own domain.</P><A NAME="integer-types"><H2>Integer Types</H2></A><P>You can start by defining binary types for reading and writing
several of the primitive types used by the ID3 format, various sizes
of unsigned integers, and four kinds of strings.</P><P>ID3 uses unsigned integers encoded in one, two, three, and four
bytes. If you first write a general <CODE>unsigned-integer</CODE> binary
type that takes the number of bytes to read as an argument, you can
then use the short form of <CODE>define-binary-type</CODE> to define the
specific types. The general <CODE>unsigned-integer</CODE> type looks like
this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type unsigned-integer (bytes)
  (:reader (in)
    (loop with value = 0
       for low-bit downfrom (* 8 (1- bytes)) to 0 by 8 do
         (setf (ldb (byte 8 low-bit) value) (read-byte in))
       finally (return value)))
  (:writer (out value)
    (loop for low-bit downfrom (* 8 (1- bytes)) to 0 by 8
       do (write-byte (ldb (byte 8 low-bit) value) out))))</PRE><P>Now you can use the short form of <CODE>define-binary-type</CODE> to define
one type for each size of integer used in the ID3 format like this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type u1 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 1))
(define-binary-type u2 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 2))
(define-binary-type u3 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 3))
(define-binary-type u4 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 4))</PRE><P>Another type you'll need to be able to read and write is the 28-bit
value used in the header. This size is encoded using 28 bits rather
than a multiple of 8, such as 32 bits, because an ID3 tag can't
contain the byte <CODE>#xff</CODE> followed by a byte with the top 3 bits
on because that pattern has a special meaning to MP3 decoders. None
of the other fields in the ID3 header could possibly contain such a
byte sequence, but if you encoded the tag size as a regular
<CODE>unsigned-integer</CODE>, it might. To avoid that possibility, the
size is encoded using only the bottom seven bits of each byte, with
the top bit always zero.<SUP>3</SUP></P><P>Thus, it can be read and written a lot like an
<CODE>unsigned-integer</CODE> except the size of the byte specifier you
pass to <CODE><B>LDB</B></CODE> should be seven rather than eight. This similarity
suggests that if you add a parameter, <CODE>bits-per-byte</CODE>, to the
existing <CODE>unsigned-integer</CODE> binary type, you could then define a
new type, <CODE>id3-tag-size</CODE>, using a short-form
<CODE>define-binary-type</CODE>. The new version of <CODE>unsigned-integer</CODE>
is just like the old version except with <CODE>bits-per-byte</CODE> used
everywhere the old version hardwired the number eight. It looks like
this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type unsigned-integer (bytes bits-per-byte)
  (:reader (in)
    (loop with value = 0
       for low-bit downfrom (* bits-per-byte (1- bytes)) to 0 by bits-per-byte do
         (setf (ldb (byte bits-per-byte low-bit) value) (read-byte in))
       finally (return value)))
  (:writer (out value)
    (loop for low-bit downfrom (* bits-per-byte (1- bytes)) to 0 by bits-per-byte
       do (write-byte (ldb (byte bits-per-byte low-bit) value) out))))</PRE><P>The definition of <CODE>id3-tag-size</CODE> is then trivial.</P><PRE>(define-binary-type id3-tag-size () (unsigned-integer :bytes 4 :bits-per-byte 7))</PRE><P>You'll also have to change the definitions of <CODE>u1</CODE> through
<CODE>u4</CODE> to specify eight bits per byte like this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type u1 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 1 :bits-per-byte 8))
(define-binary-type u2 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 2 :bits-per-byte 8))
(define-binary-type u3 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 3 :bits-per-byte 8))
(define-binary-type u4 () (unsigned-integer :bytes 4 :bits-per-byte 8))</PRE><A NAME="string-types"><H2>String Types</H2></A><P>The other kinds of primitive types that are ubiquitous in the ID3
format are strings. In the previous chapter I discussed some of the
issues you have to consider when dealing with strings in binary files,
such as the difference between character codes and character
encodings.</P><P>ID3 uses two different character codes, ISO 8859-1 and Unicode. ISO
8859-1, also known as Latin-1, is an eight-bit character code that
extends ASCII with characters used by the languages of Western
Europe. In other words, the code points from 0-127 map to the same
characters in ASCII and ISO 8859-1, but ISO 8859-1 also provides
mappings for code points up to 255. Unicode is a character code
designed to provide a code point for virtually every character of all
the world's languages. Unicode is a superset of ISO 8859-1 in the
same way that ISO 8859-1 is a superset of ASCII--the code points from
0-255 map to the same characters in both ISO 8859-1 and Unicode.
(Thus, Unicode is also a superset of ASCII.)</P><P>Since ISO 8859-1 is an eight-bit character code, it's encoded using
one byte per character. For Unicode strings, ID3 uses the UCS-2
encoding with a leading <I>byte order mark</I>.<SUP>4</SUP> I'll discuss what a byte order
mark is in a moment.</P><P>Reading and writing these two encodings isn't a problem--it's just a
question of reading and writing unsigned integers in various formats,
and you just finished writing the code to do that. The trick is how
you translate those numeric values to Lisp character objects.</P><P>The Lisp implementation you're using probably uses either Unicode or
ISO 8859-1 as its internal character code. And since all the values
from 0-255 map to the same characters in both ISO 8859-1 and Unicode,
you can use Lisp's <CODE><B>CODE-CHAR</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>CHAR-CODE</B></CODE> functions to
translate those values in both character codes. However, if your Lisp
supports only ISO 8859-1, then you'll be able to represent only the
first 255 Unicode characters as Lisp characters. In other words, in
such a Lisp implementation, if you try to process an ID3 tag that
uses Unicode strings and if any of those strings contain characters
with code points higher than 255, you'll get an error when you try to
translate the code point to a Lisp character. For now I'll assume
either you're using a Unicode-based Lisp or you won't process any
files containing characters outside the ISO 8859-1 range.</P><P>The other issue with encoding strings is how to know how many bytes
to interpret as character data. ID3 uses two strategies I mentioned
in the previous chapter--some strings are terminated with a null
character, while other strings occur in positions where you can
determine the number of bytes to read, either because the string at
that position is always the same length or because the string is at
the end of a composite structure whose overall size you know. Note,
however, that the number of bytes isn't necessarily the same as the
number of characters in the string.</P><P>Putting all these variations together, the ID3 format uses four ways
to read and write strings--two characters crossed with two ways of
delimiting the string data.</P><P>Obviously, much of the logic of reading and writing strings will be
quite similar. So, you can start by defining two binary types, one
for reading strings of a specific length (in characters) and another
for reading terminated strings. Both types take advantage of that the
type argument to <CODE>read-value</CODE> and <CODE>write-value</CODE> is just
another piece of data; you can make the type of character to read a
parameter of these types. This is a technique you'll use quite a few
times in this chapter.</P><PRE>(define-binary-type generic-string (length character-type)
  (:reader (in)
    (let ((string (make-string length)))
      (dotimes (i length)
        (setf (char string i) (read-value character-type in)))

    (loop for char across string
          do (write-value character-type out char)
          finally (write-value character-type out terminator))))</PRE><P>With these types available, there's not much to reading ISO 8859-1
strings. Because the <CODE>character-type</CODE> argument you pass to
<CODE>read-value</CODE> and <CODE>write-value</CODE> of a <CODE>generic-string</CODE>
must be the name of a binary type, you need to define an
<CODE>iso-8859-1-char</CODE> binary type. This also gives you a good place
to put a bit of sanity checking on the code points of characters you
read and write.</P><PRE>(define-binary-type iso-8859-1-char ()
  (:reader (in)
    (let ((code (read-byte in)))

          (write-byte code out)
          (error &quot;Illegal character for iso-8859-1 encoding: character: ~c with code: ~d&quot; char code)))))</PRE><P>Now defining the ISO 8859-1 string types is trivial using the short
form of <CODE>define-binary-type</CODE> as follows:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type iso-8859-1-string (length)
  (generic-string :length length :character-type 'iso-8859-1-char))

(define-binary-type iso-8859-1-terminated-string (terminator)
  (generic-terminated-string :terminator terminator :character-type 'iso-8859-1-char))</PRE><P>Reading UCS-2 strings is only slightly more complex. The complexity
arises because you can encode a UCS-2 code point in two ways: most
significant byte first (big-endian) or least significant byte first
(little-endian). UCS-2 strings therefore start with two extra bytes,
called the <I>byte order mark</I>, made up of the numeric value
<CODE>#xfeff</CODE> encoded in either big-endian form or little-endian
form. When reading a UCS-2 string, you read the byte order mark and
then, depending on its value, read either big-endian or little-endian
characters. Thus, you'll need two different UCS-2 character types.
But you need only one version of the sanity-checking code, so you can
define a parameterized binary type like this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type ucs-2-char (swap)
  (:reader (in)
    (let ((code (read-value 'u2 in)))
      (when swap (setf code (swap-bytes code)))

  (:writer (out char)
    (let ((code (char-code char)))
      (unless (&lt;= 0 code #xffff)
        (error &quot;Illegal character for ucs-2 encoding: ~c with char-code: ~d&quot; char code))
      (when swap (setf code (swap-bytes code)))
      (write-value 'u2 out code))))</PRE><P>where the <CODE>swap-bytes</CODE> function can be defined as follows,
taking advantage of <CODE><B>LDB</B></CODE> being <CODE><B>SETF</B></CODE>able and thus
<CODE><B>ROTATEF</B></CODE>able:</P><PRE>(defun swap-bytes (code)
  (assert (&lt;= code #xffff))
  (rotatef (ldb (byte 8 0) code) (ldb (byte 8 8) code))
  code)</PRE><P>Using <CODE>ucs-2-char</CODE>, you can define two character types that will
be used as the <CODE>character-type</CODE> arguments to the generic string
functions.</P><PRE>(define-binary-type ucs-2-char-big-endian () (ucs-2-char :swap nil))

(define-binary-type ucs-2-char-little-endian () (ucs-2-char :swap t))</PRE><P>Then you need a function that returns the name of the character type
to use based on the value of the byte order mark.</P><PRE>(defun ucs-2-char-type (byte-order-mark)

UCS-2-encoded strings that read the byte order mark and use it to
determine which variant of UCS-2 character to pass as the
<CODE>character-type</CODE> argument to <CODE>read-value</CODE> and
<CODE>write-value</CODE>. The only other wrinkle is that you need to
translate the <CODE>length</CODE> argument, which is a number of bytes, to
the number of characters to read, accounting for the byte order mark.</P><PRE>(define-binary-type ucs-2-string (length)

high-level view and start defining binary classes to represent first
the ID3 tag as a whole and then the individual frames.</P><P>If you turn first to the ID3v2.2 specification, you'll see that the

the code and also see what version of ID3 tags your MP3s contain.
First you can write a function that reads an <CODE>id3-tag</CODE>, as just
defined, from the beginning of a file. Be aware, however, that ID3
tags aren't required to appear at the beginning of a file, though
these days they almost always do. To find an ID3 tag elsewhere in a
file, you can scan the file looking for the sequence of bytes 73, 68,
51 (in other words, the string &quot;ID3&quot;).<SUP>5</SUP> For now
you can probably get away with assuming the tags are the first thing
in the file.</P><PRE>(defun read-id3 (file)

MP3 library, it'd be handier to have a function that returns a
summary of all the MP3 files under a given directory. You can write
one easily enough using the <CODE>walk-directory</CODE> function defined in
Chapter 15. First define a helper function that tests whether a given
filename has an <CODE>mp3</CODE> extension.</P><PRE>(defun mp3-p (file)

many ID3 tags of each version you have in your MP3 collection. To get
that information, you might write a function like this:</P><PRE>(defun count-versions (dir)

    versions))</PRE><P>Another function you'll need in Chapter 29 is one that tests whether
a file actually starts with an ID3 tag, which you can define like
this:</P><PRE>(defun id3-p (file)

frames. Each frame has a structure similar to that of the tag as a
whole. Each frame starts with a header indicating what kind of frame
it is and the size of the frame in bytes. The structure of the frame
header changed slightly between version 2.2 and version 2.3 of the
ID3 format, and eventually you'll have to deal with both forms. To
start, you can focus on parsing version 2.2 frames.</P><P>The header of a 2.2 frame consists of three bytes that encode a
three-character ISO 8859-1 string followed by a three-byte unsigned
integer, which specifies the size of the frame in bytes, excluding
the six-byte header. The string identifies what type of frame it is,
which determines how you parse the data following the size. This is
exactly the kind of situation for which you defined the
<CODE>define-tagged-binary-class</CODE> macro. You can define a tagged
class that reads the frame header and then dispatches to the
appropriate concrete class using a function that maps IDs to a class
names.</P><PRE>(define-tagged-binary-class id3-frame ()
  ((id (iso-8859-1-string :length 3))
   (size u3))
  (:dispatch (find-frame-class id)))</PRE><P>Now you're ready to start implementing concrete frame classes.
However, the specification defines quite a few--63 in version 2.2 and
even more in later specs. Even considering frame types that share a
common structure to be equivalent, you'll still find 24 unique frame
types in version 2.2. But only a few of these are used &quot;in the wild.&quot;
So rather than immediately setting to work defining classes for each
of the frame types, you can start by writing a generic frame class
that lets you read the frames in a tag without parsing the data
within the frames themselves. This will give you a way to find out
what frames are actually present in the MP3s you want to process.
You'll need this class eventually anyway because the specification
allows for experimental frames that you'll need to be able to read
without parsing.</P><P>Since the size field of the frame header tells you exactly how many
bytes long the frame is, you can define a <CODE>generic-frame</CODE> class
that extends <CODE>id3-frame</CODE> and adds a single field, <CODE>data</CODE>,
that will hold an array of bytes.</P><PRE>(define-binary-class generic-frame (id3-frame)
  ((data (raw-bytes :size size))))</PRE><P>The type of the data field, <CODE>raw-bytes</CODE>, just needs to hold an
array of bytes. You can define it like this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type raw-bytes (size)
  (:reader (in)
    (let ((buf (make-array size :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))))
      (read-sequence buf in)
      buf))
  (:writer (out buf)
    (write-sequence buf out)))</PRE><P>For the time being, you'll want all frames to be read as
<CODE>generic-frame</CODE>s, so you can define the <CODE>find-frame-class</CODE>
function used in <CODE>id3-frame</CODE>'s <CODE>:dispatch</CODE> expression to
always return <CODE>generic-frame</CODE>, regardless of the frame's
<CODE>id</CODE>.</P><PRE>(defun find-frame-class (id)
  (declare (ignore id))
  'generic-frame)</PRE><P>Now you need to modify <CODE>id3-tag</CODE> so it'll read frames after the
header fields. There's only one tricky bit to reading the frame data:
although the tag header tells you how many bytes long the tag is,
that number includes the padding that can follow the frame data.
Since the tag header doesn't tell you how many frames the tag
contains, the only way to tell when you've hit the padding is to look
for a null byte where you'd expect a frame identifier.</P><P>To handle this, you can define a binary type, <CODE>id3-frames</CODE>, that
will be responsible for reading the remainder of a tag, creating
frame objects to represent all the frames it finds, and then skipping
over any padding. This type will take as a parameter the tag size,
which it can use to avoid reading past the end of the tag. But the
reading code will also need to detect the beginning of the padding
that can follow the tag's frame data. Rather than calling
<CODE>read-value</CODE> directly in <CODE>id3-frames</CODE> <CODE>:reader</CODE>, you
should use a function <CODE>read-frame</CODE>, which you'll define to
return <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE> when it detects padding, otherwise returning an
<CODE>id3-frame</CODE> object read using <CODE>read-value</CODE>. Assuming you
define <CODE>read-frame</CODE> so it reads only one byte past the end of
the last frame in order to detect the start of the padding, you can
define the <CODE>id3-frames</CODE> binary type like this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-type id3-frames (tag-size)

frame classes you need to implement. But first let's add support for

versions of ID3, it makes more sense to use a
<CODE>define-tagged-binary-class</CODE> that dispatches on the
<CODE>major-version</CODE> value. As it turns out, all versions of ID3v2
have the same structure up to the size field. So, you can define a
tagged binary class like the following that defines this basic
structure and then dispatches to the appropriate version-specific
subclass:</P><PRE>(define-tagged-binary-class id3-tag ()

     (3 'id3v2.3-tag))))</PRE><P>Version 2.2 and version 2.3 tags differ in two ways. First, the
header of a version 2.3 tag may be extended with up to four optional
extended header fields, as determined by values in the flags field.
Second, the frame format changed between version 2.2 and version 2.3,
which means you'll have to use different classes to represent version
2.2 frames and the corresponding version 2.3 frames.</P><P>Since the new <CODE>id3-tag</CODE> class is based on the one you originally
wrote to represent version 2.2 tags, it's not surprising that the new
<CODE>id3v2.2-tag</CODE> class is trivial, inheriting most of its slots
from the new <CODE>id3-tag</CODE> class and adding the one missing slot,
<CODE>frames</CODE>. Because version 2.2 and version 2.3 tags use different
frame formats, you'll have to change the <CODE>id3-frames</CODE> type to be
parameterized with the type of frame to read. For now, assume you'll
do that and add a <CODE>:frame-type</CODE> argument to the
<CODE>id3-frames</CODE> type descriptor like this:</P><PRE>(define-binary-class id3v2.2-tag (id3-tag)
  ((frames (id3-frames :tag-size size :frame-type 'id3v2.2-frame))))</PRE><P>The <CODE>id3v2.3-tag</CODE> class is slightly more complex because of the
optional fields. The first three of the four optional fields are
included when the sixth bit in <CODE>flags</CODE> is set. They're a four-
byte integer specifying the size of the extended header, two bytes
worth of flags, and another four-byte integer specifying how many
bytes of padding are included in the tag.<SUP>7</SUP> The fourth optional field, included when
the fifteenth bit of the extended header flags is set, is a four-byte
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of the rest of the tag.</P><P>The binary data library doesn't provide any special support for
optional fields in a binary class, but it turns out that regular
parameterized binary types are sufficient. You can define a type
parameterized with the name of a type and a value that indicates
whether a value of that type should actually be read or written.</P><PRE>(define-binary-type optional (type if)

code, but it makes the <CODE>optional</CODE> type descriptors quite

using <CODE>optional</CODE> slots:</P><PRE>(define-binary-class id3v2.3-tag (id3-tag)

you'll do in the next two sections. If you decide later that you want
to support other frame types, it's mostly a matter of translating the
ID3 specifications into the appropriate binary class definitions.</P><A NAME="text-information-frames"><H2>Text Information Frames</H2></A><P>All text information frames consist of two fields: a single byte
indicating which string encoding is used in the frame and a string
encoded in the remaining bytes of the frame. If the encoding byte is
zero, the string is encoded in ISO 8859-1; if the encoding is one,
the string is a UCS-2 string.</P><P>You've already defined binary types representing the four different
kinds of strings--two different encodings each with two different
methods of delimiting the string. However, <CODE>define-binary-class</CODE>

type that you pass the value of the encoding byte and that then reads
or writes the appropriate kind of string.</P><P>As long as you're defining such a type, you can also define it to
take two parameters, <CODE>:length</CODE> and <CODE>:terminator</CODE>, and pick
the right type of string based on which argument is supplied. To

have a lot of directions you could take this code. If you want to
develop a complete ID3 tag editor, you'll need to implement specific
classes for all the frame types. You'd also need to define methods
for manipulating the tag and frame objects in a consistent way (for
instance, if you change the value of a string in a
<CODE>text-info-frame</CODE>, you'll likely need to adjust the size); as
the code stands, there's nothing to make sure that
happens.<SUP>9</SUP></P><P>Or, if you just need to extract certain pieces of information about
an MP3 file from its ID3 tag--as you will when you develop a
streaming MP3 server in Chapters 27, 28, and 29--you'll need to write
functions that find the appropriate frames and extract the
information you want.</P><P>Finally, to make this production-quality code, you'd have to pore
over the ID3 specs and deal with the details I skipped over in the
interest of space. In particular, some of the flags in both the tag
and the frame can affect the way the contents of the tag or frame is
read; unless you write some code that does the right thing when those
flags are set, there may be ID3 tags that this code won't be able to
parse correctly. But the code from this chapter should be capable of
parsing nearly all the MP3s you actually encounter.</P><P>For now you can finish with a few functions to extract individual
pieces of information from an <CODE>id3-tag</CODE>. You'll need these
functions in Chapter 27 and probably in other code that uses this
library. They belong in this library because they depend on details
of the ID3 format that the users of this library shouldn't have to
worry about.</P><P>To get, say, the name of the song of the MP3 from which an
<CODE>id3-tag</CODE> was extracted, you need to find the ID3 frame with a
specific identifier and then extract the information field. And some
pieces of information, such as the genre, can require further
decoding. Luckily, all the frames that contain the information you'll
care about are text information frames, so extracting a particular
piece of information mostly boils down to using the right identifier
to look up the appropriate frame. Of course, the ID3 authors decided
to change all the identifiers between ID3v2.2 and ID3v2.3, so you'll
have to account for that.</P><P>Nothing too complex--you just need to figure out the right path to
get to the various pieces of information. This is a perfect bit of
code to develop interactively, much the way you figured out what
frame classes you needed to implement. To start, you need an
<CODE>id3-tag</CODE> object to play with. Assuming you have an MP3 laying

the <CODE>information</CODE> slot of a text information frame, though not
officially a null-terminated string, can contain a null, and ID3
readers are supposed to ignore any characters after the null. So, you
need a function that takes a string and returns the contents up to
the first null character, if any. That's easy enough using the

the only difference between this code and the code you'll use to
extract the other pieces of information you'll need (such as the
album name, the artist, and the genre) is the identifier. So, it's
better to split up the code a bit. For starters, you can write a
function that just finds a frame given an <CODE>id3-tag</CODE> and an
identifier like this:</P><PRE>(defun find-frame (id3 id)
  (find id (frames id3) :test #'string= :key #'id))

ID3V2&gt; (find-frame *id3* &quot;TT2&quot;)
#&lt;TEXT-INFO-FRAME-V2.2 @ #x73d04cca&gt;</PRE><P>Then the other bit of code, the part that extracts the information
from a <CODE>text-info-frame</CODE>, can go in another function.</P><PRE>(defun get-text-info (id3 id)
  (let ((frame (find-frame id3 id)))
    (when frame (upto-null (information frame)))))

ID3V2&gt; (get-text-info *id3* &quot;TT2&quot;)
&quot;Byla Cesta&quot;</PRE><P>Now the definition of <CODE>song</CODE> is just a matter of passing the
right identifier.</P><PRE>(defun song (id3) (get-text-info id3 &quot;TT2&quot;))

ID3V2&gt; (song *id3*)
&quot;Byla Cesta&quot;</PRE><P>However, this definition of <CODE>song</CODE> works only with version 2.2
tags since the identifier changed from &quot;TT2&quot; to &quot;TIT2&quot; between
version 2.2 and version 2.3. And all the other tags changed too.
Since the user of this library shouldn't have to know about different
versions of the ID3 format to do something as simple as get the song
title, you should probably handle those details for them. A simple
way is to change <CODE>find-frame</CODE> to take not just a single
identifier but a list of identifiers like this:</P><PRE>(defun find-frame (id3 ids)
  (find-if #'(lambda (x) (find (id x) ids :test #'string=)) (frames id3)))</PRE><P>Then change <CODE>get-text-info</CODE> slightly so it can take one or more

    (when frame (upto-null (information frame)))))</PRE><P>Then the change needed to allow <CODE>song</CODE> to support both version
2.2 and version 2.3 tags is just a matter of adding the version 2.3
identifier.</P><PRE>(defun song (id3) (get-text-info id3 &quot;TT2&quot; &quot;TIT2&quot;))</PRE><P>Then you just need to look up the appropriate version 2.2 and version
2.3 frame identifiers for any fields for which you want to provide an
accessor function. Here are the ones you'll need in Chapter 27:</P><PRE>(defun album (id3) (get-text-info id3 &quot;TAL&quot; &quot;TALB&quot;))

(defun genre (id3) (get-text-info id3 &quot;TCO&quot; &quot;TCON&quot;))</PRE><P>The last wrinkle is that the way the <CODE>genre</CODE> is stored in the
TCO or TCON frames isn't always human readable. Recall that in ID3v1,
genres were stored as a single byte that encoded a particular genre
from a fixed list. Unfortunately, those codes live on in ID3v2--if
the text of the genre frame is a number in parentheses, the number is
supposed to be interpreted as an ID3v1 genre code. But, again, users
of this library probably won't care about that ancient history. So,
you should provide a function that automatically translates the
genre. The following function uses the <CODE>genre</CODE> function just
defined to extract the actual genre text and then checks whether it
starts with a left parenthesis, decoding the version 1 genre code
with a function you'll define in a moment if it does:</P><PRE>(defun translated-genre (id3)

    (if (and genre (char= #\( (char genre 0)))
      (translate-v1-genre genre)

array of standard names, the easiest way to implement
<CODE>translate-v1-genre</CODE> is to extract the number from the genre
string and use it as an index into an actual array.</P><PRE>(defun translate-v1-genre (genre)
  (aref *id3-v1-genres* (parse-integer genre :start 1 :junk-allowed t)))</PRE><P>Then all you need to do is to define the array of names. The

rest of the file you must replace the old tag with a new tag of
exactly the same length. By writing ID3 tags with a certain amount of
padding, you have a better chance of being able to do so--if the new
tag has more data than the original tag, you use less padding, and if
it's shorter, you use more.</P><P><SUP>3</SUP>The frame data following the ID3 header
could also potentially contain the illegal sequence. That's prevented
using a different scheme that's turned on via one of the flags in the
tag header. The code in this chapter doesn't account for the
possibility that this flag might be set; in practice it's rarely
used.</P><P><SUP>4</SUP>In ID3v2.4, UCS-2
is replaced by the virtually identical UTF-16, and UTF-16BE and UTF-8
are added as additional encodings.</P><P><SUP>5</SUP>The 2.4 version of the
ID3 format also supports placing a footer at the end of a tag, which
makes it easier to find a tag appended to the end of a file.</P><P><SUP>6</SUP>Character streams support two functions,
<CODE><B>PEEK-CHAR</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>UNREAD-CHAR</B></CODE>, either of which would be a
perfect solution to this problem, but binary streams support no
equivalent functions.</P><P><SUP>7</SUP>If a tag had an
extended header, you could use this value to determine where the
frame data should end. However, if the extended header isn't used,
you'd have to use the old algorithm anyway, so it's not worth adding
code to do it another way.</P><P><SUP>8</SUP>These flags, in addition to controlling whether the
optional fields are included, can affect the parsing of the rest of
the tag. In particular, if the seventh bit of the flags is set, then
the actual frame data is compressed using the zlib algorithm, and if
the sixth bit is set, the data is encrypted. In practice these
options are rarely, if ever, used, so you can get away with ignoring
them for now. But that would be an area you'd have to address to make
this a production-quality ID3 library. One simple half solution would
be to change <CODE>find-frame-class</CODE> to accept a second argument and
pass it the flags; if the frame is compressed or encrypted, you could
instantiate a generic frame to hold the data.</P><P><SUP>9</SUP>Ensuring that kind of interfield consistency would be a
fine application for <CODE>:after</CODE> methods on the accessor generic
functions. For instance, you could define this <CODE>:after</CODE> method
to keep <CODE>size</CODE> in sync with the <CODE>information</CODE> string:</P><PRE>(defmethod (setf information) :after (value (frame text-info-frame))
  (declare (ignore value))
  (with-slots (encoding size information) frame
    (setf size (encoded-string-length information encoding nil))))</PRE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
